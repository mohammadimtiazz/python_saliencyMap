# python_saliencyMap
The goal of a saliency map is to simplified or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.

It is a part of Image segmentation world. More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.

In another defination, Saliency at a given location is determined primarily by how different this location is from its surround in color, orientation, motion, depth etc. 

here, a function of salincy map is provided whihc can be used in any color image as a part of segmenting features.
